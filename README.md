## About  

Welcome to Puppyplaymates, a webapp to help dogs find love! 
This is a Python Flask app using MongoDB, cloudinary and Flask Mail to produce a social media style application.

PuppyPlaymates currently brings users together and allows them to get in contact with the pups they love! The application lets the users create a profile that allows them to add their dogs details, add photos, let other users know when the next walk with their dog is happening, add comments both public and private and add likes on other profiles.  The site offers the additional functionality, reset passwords, change passwords, reporting other users, contact us, editing and deleting comments, backend validation, profanity checking and birthday checking. Please take a look at the [features](#features) section for a more detailed description. 

The application has a lot of room for growth and a list of future features to implement.

## Features

#### Universal Features Across the Site

###### Logo and Navigation Bar
The Navigation Bar is at the top of the webpage. The logo and nav links all change colour when they are hovered over. The active page is set to pink, so the user knows what page they are on.  The nav links direct the user to the correct page of the website. When the logo is clicked on it will take the user to the home page. 


###### Responsiveness

The website is fully responsive between different screen resolutions.  I have done this by using media queries.  I have changed the width and included content within containers so that everything stays neat and in the correct order.  The test can be taken on a phone although it has been designed for large screens to mimic real word working conditions. 

###### Accessibility

###### Input Fields 

* The email input fields are type specific, so will need to have a valid email and text, they are also set to be required in order for the user to submit. 
* The calculator is number specific so users can not enter anything other than a number. 

###### Footer 

The Footer is split into three sections, an opening hours, copyright and contact. Although this is a testing website rather than a business users may want to get in contact with the website developers to let them know of any bugs or to ask questions about visual stress.   


##### Meta data

I have added keywords, author and description to the meta data to make the website easier to find.  This increases traffic to the website.  I have also given each page a different name, so the user knows which tab they are on. 


##### Redirect

Using app@route rendering templates

## Testing 

[TESTING DOC ](readme_docs/testing.md)

Please see the testing document for Testing logs 






## Deployment 

### Adding and Committing files

To add files to the repository take the following steps

In the command line type -
        git add .  
        git commit -m "This is being committed"
        git push

To add all new files or modified file use " ."  - To add a single file use the pathway to the file eg .index.html  or assets/css/style.css
When committing make sure your comments are clear about what changes have been made. 
Pushing will send your work to the repository

### Deployment 

The project was deployed with the following steps


### Forking

Forking the GitHub Repository


By forking the GitHub Repository, you can make a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.  This means we can view or make changes without making the changes affecting the original.

* Log into GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
* At the top of the Repository there is a "Fork" button about the "Settings" button on the menu.
* You should now have a new copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account.

### Cloning 

Making a Local Clone

* Log into your GitHub then find the gitpod repository
* Under the repository name there is a button that says "Clone or download". Click on this button.
* If cloning with HTTPS "Clone with HTTPS", copy this link.
* Open Gitbash
* Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be.
* Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.

        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
        Press - Enter- Your local clone will be created.
        $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
                > Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
                > remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
                > remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
                > remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
                > Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
